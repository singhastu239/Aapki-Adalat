        <p style="font-size: 30px">This is Aapki Adalat Seva</p>
        <p>
          Hi  I am Stuti Singh ,A student of Techno Main Salt Lake,Computer Science Engineering. 
          I created a management system for court cases which basically automates the entire court
          process. This will help both the petitioner and respondent become more
          accessible towards their trial, their advocate, trial date and so on.
          This will reduce the chance of petitioner and respondent to miss their
          trial which ultimately results in the backlogging of cases which is
          considered to be a major problem in the court.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px">Phases Of  The  Project</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px">PHASE 1</p>
        <p>
          This is the registration phase. This is where the client and the
          advocate will register themselves to use the services. In the client
          registration process the client will give information about his
          particulars including his Aadhar card number and other verification
          details, to prevent the use for any fraudulent activities. The
          registration process for advocate is also the same except we will
          request their Bar Enrolment number to check his/her credentials.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px">PHASE 2</p>
        <p>
          This phase constitutes of the background processes that takes place
          after the user enters his/her credentials. The system will check the
          veracity of the details entered by the user and the advocate. The
          system will process the information and matches the client and the
          advocate according to the type of case and the specialized field given
          during the registration phase.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px">PHASE 3</p>
        <p>
          This phase constitutes of almost all the main processes for which this
          web-based app was built. This is the phase where the invoice is added
          for each hearing and for different heads under which lawyers charge
          the clients. It provides end to end management of court case from
          client perspective. The app also gives intimation while there is a
          hearing and records the information about the ongoing case on a
          regular basis. Once the case is closed, the details of the case will
          be uploaded to a public forum where any interested user can access it
