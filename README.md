Hi, I am Stuti Singh ,A student of Techno Main Salt Lake,Computer Science Engineering. I created a management system for court cases which basically automates the entire court process. This will help both the
petitioner and respondent become more accessible towards their trial, their advocate, trial date and so on. This will reduce the chance of petitioner and respondent to miss their trial which ultimately results in the backlogging of cases which is considered to be a major problem in the court.
